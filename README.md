## Lambda itself
Hearth of the solution lies in the Src folder

## API
POST ðŸ”’ method is guarded by JWT token in standard header "bearer"

| Method  | Endpoint              | Info                                                                         |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET     | `/token`              | forwards (HTTP303) caller to where to obtain JWT token for posting to topic |
| GET     | `/topics`             | lists available topics                                                       |
| GET     | `/topics/{topicName}` | schema for given topic                                                       |
| POST ðŸ”’  | `/topics/{topicName}` | posts payload (after authorization and schema validation) into kafka topic   |
| POST    | `terminate`           | kills lambda - useful for when forcing config reload is desired              |


## Config
There are 3 configs for this solution (in conf folder)

- config.json
  - this one needs to live in the conf folder
  - defines where are other resources/configs
- access.json
  - this one could be local or in AWS S3
  - defines who has access to post to individual topics
- topics.json
  - this one could be local or in AWS S3
  - defines schema of the topics, as well as enumerates those


## Terraform Deplyoment
Whole solution expects to be deployed as lambda in AWS,
there are prepared terraform scripts to make initial deplyoment, and can be found in "terraform" fodler
All that is needed is supplementing variables for
 - aws_region
 - vpc_id
 - resource prefix - all terraform resources would be prefixed my this prefix, usefull when mixed-in with something else
 - lambda_role_arn - the role for the lambda, should be able to make HTTP calls to wherever kafka server lives
 - lambda_vpc_subnet_ids
 
Once tfvars are supplied, go terraform apply and you are done

## Scripts
Useful scripts for dev and Deployment

### Notebook
Jupyter notebook, with one cell for lambda initialization and one cell per method, for testing purposes
Obviously using it requires correct configs to be in place (PUBLIC key is being loaded during initilization)

### Preapare Deployment
shell script for fetching pithon requirements and ziping it together with sources and config into lambda archive, ready to be used by terraform
